# HueHarmony
project_submission for TechTogether Online

## Inspiration 💡✨
Approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women worldwide experience some form of color blindness. That means millions of individuals face challenges when it comes to perceiving and differentiating certain colors. In order to make web browsing seamless and accessible for everyone on the internet. I made this chrome extension.

## What it does 🚩✨
HueHarmony is a Chrome extension designed to assist individuals with color blindness in enhancing their browsing experience. Color blindness affects millions of people worldwide, making it challenging to perceive and differentiate between various colors. This extension aims to bridge this gap by providing customizable color filters and real-time adjustments that compensate for color vision deficiencies.

Users can select between two color filters; namely Deuteranopia (green color blindness) and Protanopia (red color blindness). The extension then injects the color filter into different components of the webpage.

## How we built it 🧱✨
Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Manifest

## Challenges we ran into 🧗✨
There were some bugs that I resolved, but there are still some remaining :( I had trouble understanding which filters to use for the extension. Initially, I tried using CSS variables, which worked for a little while but then stopped. Fortunately, I learned about javascript, which solved my problem

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆✨
I did this all by myself: the documentation, the slides, the demo video and the actual project. And I am so proud of it all. It was the first time I could make and finish a Chrome extension all by myself. Of course, I am thankful for all YouTube tutorials and Stack Overflow.

I really enjoyed participating in a hackathon and making a Chrome extension, and submitting it. I absolutely loved the MLH community and loved interacting with everyone I had a chance with. I can't wait to make more projects.

## What we learned 🏫✨
I learnt a lot about making Chrome extensions, color blindness and web/app development. Also, about managing projects and successfully pulling together all-nighters.

## What's next for HueHarmony 🔮✨
I hope to add more color filters and work on its UI/UX.
